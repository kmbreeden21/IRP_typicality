# IRP_typicality

## Overview 
This experiment shows images to participants and asks how typical that object is of its category in general. 
For example, "how typical is this object of clocks in general?" when the participant is shown an image of a clock. 

Trial order is randomized for each participant. 

TO DO: Catch trials are included -- for example: "How typical is this object of clocks in general?" when the participant is shown an image of a dog. 

After the typicality ratings, participants are asked a few demographics questions, and are finally given a generated code to input into mturk for reimbursement. 

Data is saved directly to OSF at the end of the experiment.
